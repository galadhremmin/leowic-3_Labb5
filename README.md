RTAPI for iOS
==============
This is a technical demonstration and examination of the public retirement savings API maintained by a conglomeration of Swedish unions. The project is named *leowic-3_Labb5* as is a requirement stipulated by the University this work is conducted for.


Disclaimer
---------
This is by no means a finished product. In fact, it's not even a productâ€“it's a technical demonstration developed within the context of a module assignment. The integration to the aforementioned API is by no means complete, and there are a variety of features which deliberately remain unused due to timeboxing. 


Installation instructions
------------------------
To succesfully compile this project, you will need CoreParse and CorePlot. Fortunately, [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) makes it easy to set it up.

* Install CocoaPods
`sudo gem install cocoapods`

* Enter the project directory (the same directory where the xcodeproj file is located) and execute `pod install`

* A Xcode workspace file is created in the root directory named *leowic-3_Labb5.xcworkspace*. Open it up, and compile the app through Xcode.

Running the app
--------------
To successfully run this app, you will need to acquire an API key. Once you have a valid API key, you must choose which fictive person you'd like to log in as.
